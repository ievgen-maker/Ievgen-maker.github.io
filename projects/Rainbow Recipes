## Overview

Rainbow Recipes is a team-built web application where users can browse and save recipes, view vendor information, and connect the cooking workflow to real places through a vendor map. The live site is available at [https://rainbow-recipes.vercel.app](https://rainbow-recipes.vercel.app), and the GitHub organization page is [https://rainbow-recipes.github.io](https://rainbow-recipes.github.io) for anyone who wants the broader project context.

## Contributions

I designed and implemented the site footer to keep navigation consistent and polished across the app, and I worked on backend database schema creation and management to keep our data model clean and reliable as features grew. I also contributed the vendor map feature, built out the profile page, wrote Playwright tests to catch regressions early, configured sign-in and sign-out functionality, and supported the team through risk management and coordination when priorities shifted as the holidays and exams started affecting everyones schedules. 

## What I Learned

The best lesson for me was how teamwork becomes easier when the system is built from independent parts that cooperate without clinging to each other. Once components are separated clearly, multiple people can move fast at the same time without constantly colliding (a.k.a. having issues version issues through Git), and the project starts to feel like one thing instead of a pile of unfinished ideas.
