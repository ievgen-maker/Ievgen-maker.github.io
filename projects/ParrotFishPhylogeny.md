summary: "I performed an Indepenedent Research study with the Carlon Lab at Bowdoin college to better understand population structure of parrot fish populations. This was accomplished through testing previosly established computational programs in comparasion to open sourced programs to not onlty derive the phylogeny of parrot fish but also to test efficiency and accurancy of softwares used."

This project focused on investigating the population structure of parrotfish across the Pacific through computational phylogenetics. Using genomic data from 81 parrotfish samples stored in VCF (variant call format) files, I applied several methods designed for phylogenetic inference and species tree construction. These included PAUP+ with the SVDquartets algorithm, as well as newer approaches like CASTER and ASTRAL. Each program carries different assumptions and computational strategies, so the goal of the project was not only to reconstruct the evolutionary history of these populations but also to compare how software choice can influence both the accuracy and efficiency of phylogenetic analysis.

My role was to design and carry out the entire computational analysis independently. I prepared the dataset, ran the phylogenetic inference programs, and systematically compared their outputs. I was responsible for testing multiple pipelines—ranging from widely established software like PAUP+ to newer, open-source alternatives such as ASTRAL and CASTER—and for interpreting the differences in the results. In addition to running the analyses, I evaluated runtime performance, usability, and the congruence of the inferred trees. This required both technical problem-solving skills and careful consideration of biological questions around population structure and species divergence. I was solely responsible for the execution, data interpretation, and comparative evaluation.

Through this research, I learned how to bridge biology and computation in a meaningful way. I developed hands-on skills in managing large genomic datasets, running complex phylogenetic algorithms, and interpreting species tree results in an evolutionary biology context. More broadly, I gained insight into the strengths and limitations of different computational approaches—understanding where traditional tools remain valuable and where newer methods provide advantages in speed, accessibility, or scalability. This experience reinforced the importance of methodological choice in genomics research and gave me a framework for critically evaluating software in other areas of computational biology.
