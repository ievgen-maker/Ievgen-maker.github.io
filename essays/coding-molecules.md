*The future of medicine may belong to those who can read both molecules and code.*

## Where It All Started

Back in high school biology, I was fascinated that such a small strand of DNA could tell you something as big as eye color—or why one person might get sick. Around the same time, I had a computer science class. At first it was curiosity, and soon I was hooked. I was amazed by how writing a few lines of code could make a computer do exactly what I wanted it to do.  

For a long time, I thought these two things would never come together—biology and coding—until I discovered they do! One existed under a microscope; the other lived on a laptop screen. It wasn’t until college that I began to realize how well they could work together.  

## Getting Hooked on Biochemistry

When I chose biochemistry as my major, I wanted to know what made up life. Courses in molecules, enzymes, and genetics helped me feel as if I was learning a secret language of the body. I started to realize that medicine is really one big puzzle made up of molecules.  

But as I was learning all of this, I saw a pattern: the puzzles were too big to solve by hand. That’s when I began to see computer science as more than a side interest—it was the missing piece of the puzzle.  

## Learning to Speak Code

In my coding classes, I began with the fundamentals: loops, recursion, and algorithms. It felt like learning a new language—one that could translate a messy problem into step-by-step instructions.  

It didn’t take long to realize that science and medicine generate huge amounts of messy data. A single genetics test can provide more information than any individual could ever analyze on their own. That’s where coding comes in: it helps us actually gain insight into what the data means.  

## Research: Making Two Sides Come Together

By my second year of college, I wanted to connect these two worlds. I worked on a research project that investigated small, ring-shaped molecules called **azirines**, which might be useful for new drug design. My job was to run computer models to predict how these molecules would interact. Basically, I asked the computer to “play out” possible reactions and show us what might happen in real life.  

Later, I completed a project mapping the ancestry of parrotfish. We used genetic data to determine how closely related different species were and when they diverged. On the surface these projects were very different, but they all taught me the same lesson: biology and coding aren’t separate—they’re partners.  

## Seeing the Human Side

Outside of research, I shadowed clinical geneticists. Their responsibility is to translate complicated test results into something families can understand. That experience reminded me that science is not just about numbers—it’s about people.  

That idea stuck with me. Whether I’m coding or studying molecules, the reality is that the goal is the same: to help someone live a healthier life.  

## Why I Want to Combine Both

It’s impossible for me to imagine studying genetics without computers. And I can’t imagine writing code without aiming it at something meaningful. Combining the two just feels natural.  

Imagine a program that instantly compares a patient’s test results with thousands of others around the world. Or a simple picture that shows exactly where a chemical pathway is breaking down in someone’s body. That’s the kind of work I want to do—tools doctors can use to get answers more quickly and more clearly.  

## Looking Ahead

I know this path will be tough. Becoming a clinical biochemical geneticist means years of study in medicine, chemistry, and lab work. It also means continuing to grow as a programmer. But every step I’ve taken—high school biology, first coding projects, lab research, shadowing doctors—has made me more certain.  

My goal is simple: to become someone who understands both molecules and code, and apply that understanding to improving genetic medicine for patients.
